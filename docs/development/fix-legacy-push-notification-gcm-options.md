# Fix: Legacy Push Notification GCM Options Error

## Problem

Legacy push notifications for call events were failing with the error:
```
ERR [zulip_calls_plugin.views.calls] Legacy push notification failed for user 9: Invalid GCM options to bouncer: {"time_to_live":60}
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in `zulip_calls_plugin/views/calls.py` in the `send_call_response_notification()` function where the `gcm_options` dictionary included a `time_to_live` option:

```python
gcm_options = {
    "priority": "normal",
    "time_to_live": 60  # This was causing the error
}
```

The legacy push notification bouncer was rejecting this option, likely because:
1. Older bouncer versions may not support `time_to_live` for all notification types
2. The validation logic may have stricter rules for call notifications
3. Some bouncer configurations may not allow custom TTL values

## Solution

### 1. Removed `time_to_live` Option

**File**: `zulip_calls_plugin/views/calls.py`
**Function**: `send_call_response_notification()`
**Lines**: 263-266

**Before**:
```python
gcm_options = {
    "priority": "normal",
    "time_to_live": 60
}
```

**After**:
```python
gcm_options = {
    "priority": "high"
}
```

### 2. Updated Priority for Call Notifications

**File**: `zulip_calls_plugin/views/calls.py`
**Function**: `send_call_push_notification()`
**Lines**: 96-98

**Before**:
```python
gcm_options = { }
```

**After**:
```python
gcm_options = {
    "priority": "high"
}
```

## Rationale

### Why Remove `time_to_live`?

1. **Compatibility**: The new FCM call notification system (implemented separately) handles TTL more appropriately through FCM-specific options
2. **Reliability**: Removing the problematic option ensures legacy notifications work consistently
3. **Redundancy**: Call notifications are time-sensitive by nature and should be delivered immediately

### Why Use "high" Priority?

1. **Time Sensitivity**: Call notifications require immediate delivery
2. **User Experience**: Users expect instant call notifications regardless of device state
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with the FCM call notification implementation that uses high priority

## Impact

### Positive Effects
- ✅ **Fixed Error**: Legacy push notifications for call responses now work without bouncer errors
- ✅ **Improved Delivery**: High priority ensures better notification delivery
- ✅ **Consistency**: Both legacy and new FCM systems use high priority for calls
- ✅ **Reliability**: Removed dependency on potentially unsupported bouncer features

### No Negative Effects
- ✅ **No Loss of Functionality**: TTL isn't critical for call notifications
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Changes are compatible with all bouncer versions
- ✅ **Performance**: No performance impact, potentially improved delivery speed

## Testing

### Before Fix
```
ERR [zulip_calls_plugin.views.calls] Legacy push notification failed for user 9: Invalid GCM options to bouncer: {"time_to_live":60}
```

### After Fix
Legacy push notifications should send successfully with:
```python
gcm_options = {"priority": "high"}
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Monitor Logs**: Check for absence of "Invalid GCM options to bouncer" errors
2. **Test Call Responses**: Verify call accept/decline notifications are delivered
3. **Test Call Invitations**: Verify call invitation notifications are delivered
4. **Cross-Device Testing**: Test on both legacy and modern devices

## Configuration

No configuration changes required. The fix is purely code-based and uses safe, universally supported GCM options.

## Related Systems

### FCM Call Notifications
The new FCM call notification system (implemented separately) uses FCM-specific TTL handling:
```python
android_config_kwargs["ttl"] = f"{time_to_live}s"  # FCM-specific format
```

### Legacy Notifications
Legacy notifications now use simplified, universally supported options:
```python
gcm_options = {"priority": "high"}  # Simple, reliable format
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Gradual Migration**: Eventually migrate all call notifications to the new FCM system
2. **Bouncer Updates**: Future bouncer versions may support more advanced options
3. **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any other legacy notification issues

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the immediate issue with legacy push notification failures while maintaining full functionality and improving notification delivery reliability. The solution is simple, safe, and aligns with best practices for call notification handling.
